function [c,sign] = sub_int(a, b)
%SUB_INT Substracts two integers represented as arrays.
%
%   a, b, and c are arrays where each element is a digit 
%   in a high precision representation of an integer.
%   sign is -1 if (the number represented by) b is larger
%   than a, +1 if it is smaller, and 0 if they are equal.
